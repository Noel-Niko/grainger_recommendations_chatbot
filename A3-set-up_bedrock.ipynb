    "Interaction with the Bedrock API is done via the AWS SDK for Python: [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).\n",

    "Depending on your environment, you might need to customize the setup when creating your Bedrock service client. To help with this, the `get_bedrock_client()` utility method supports passing in different options. The implementation is in [../utils/bedrock.py](../utils/bedrock.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use different clients\n",
    "The boto3 provides different clients for Amazon Bedrock to perform different actions. The actions for [`InvokeModel`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html) and [`InvokeModelWithResponseStream`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.html) are supported by Amazon Bedrock Runtime where as other operations, such as [ListFoundationModels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListFoundationModels.html), are handled via [Amazon Bedrock client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Bedrock.html).\n",

    "The `get_bedrock_client()` method accepts `runtime` (default=True) parameter to return either `bedrock` or `bedrock-runtime` client.\n",

    "If you are running this notebook from [Amazon Sagemaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/) and your Sagemaker Studio [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html) has permissions to access Bedrock you can just run the cells below as-is. This is also the case if you are running these notebooks from a computer whose default AWS credentials have access to Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a different AWS Region\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this notebook from your own computer or a SageMaker notebook in a different AWS Region from where Bedrock is set up, you can un-comment the `os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']` line below and specify the region to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a specific profile\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you're running this notebook from your own computer where you have setup the AWS CLI with multiple profiles, and the profile which has access to Bedrock is not the default one, you can un-comment the `os.environ['AWS_PROFILE']` line below and specify the profile to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a different role\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you or your company has setup a specific, separate [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) to access Bedrock, you can specify it by un-commenting the `os.environ['BEDROCK_ASSUME_ROLE']` line below. Ensure that your current user or role have permissions to [assume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) such role.\n",

To customize your Bedrock configuration, explicitly create the Bedrock client using the method below, and pass it to the [`langchain.Bedrock`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/bedrock) class instantiation method using `client=boto3_bedrock`"
